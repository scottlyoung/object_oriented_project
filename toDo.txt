1. Organize the github directory the way a package should be
	-the random .iml file and out/ are created by an intellij project
	-not perfect but manageable for now
2. Make backend work correctly with player, make a perfect text menu
	-uniqueness
	-player playing the correct songs
	-make sure admin accounts are create properly
	-handle incorrect input
3. Add the database to work with the DBManager object
4. Alert group of current state of backend
5. Potentially move on to make the front end
